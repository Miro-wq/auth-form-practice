# Project Description:

This project serves as a testing ground for various authentication functions and iframe implementations. It provides a sandbox environment to experiment with different authentication mechanisms, such as password-based authentication, token-based authentication, or OAuth, and to explore the integration of iframes into web applications.

# Key Features:

Authentication Functions: Experiment with different authentication methods by testing functionalities such as password authentication, token validation, and user session management.
Iframe Integration: Explore the integration of iframes into web applications for embedding external content, such as maps, videos, or other web pages. Test how iframes interact with the parent document and handle communication between frames.
Sandbox Environment: Utilize a sandbox environment to safely test authentication and iframe functionalities without affecting production systems. Develop and debug authentication mechanisms and iframe implementations with ease.
Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
